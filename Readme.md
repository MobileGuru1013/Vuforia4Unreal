Troubleshooting
--------
### Build failed
- Ensure that you have copied the Vuforia SDK inside the Plugins VuforiaSDK folder

### Black screen
- Ensure you have set your Vuforia License Key in the Project Settings
- Ensure you have copied the two Assets (BlankTexture.uasset and M_DynamicTexture.uasset) inside your Project Content folder
- Remove the Vuforia Actor from the World and readd it to the World, don't forget to set the "Auto Player Activation" to "Player 0"

### No Content shown on the Target
- If you can see the Camera stream, but your Content is not shown on the Target (stonesandchips), be sure that your Content is placed at 0,0,0 in World coordinates. The Plugin currently only supports one Target, whos Content needs to be in the middle of the World.
- Ensure that you react on the TrackingLost/Found Events (for an example how to use them look at the level blueprint in the project of this Repository)
